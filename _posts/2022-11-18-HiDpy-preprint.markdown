Happy to share with you, my recent collaboration together with Marwan Abdellah, Roman Barth and Haitham A. Shaban.

We developed a new open-source implementation of High-resolution Diffusion mapping (Hi-D) in Python programming language.

<strong>Genome-wide analysis of the dynamic and biophysical properties of chromatin and nuclear proteins in living cells with Hi-D.</strong>
