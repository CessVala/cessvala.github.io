<p align="justify">Hi, my name is Cesar Augusto Valades-Cruz. I am a Postdoctoral researcher of Serpico/STED joint team at Curie Institute and Inria Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique. My project is focused on microscope development and image analysis.</p>

<p align="justify">My background is quite broad as I studied Mechatronics Engineering. Then, I got a MSc in Nanophotonics. Later, I completed a PhD in Biophotonics from Fresnel Institute and ICFO. My master and PhD were founded by Erasmus Mundus. My PhD was centered on quantitative nanoscale imaging of orientational order in biological filaments (actin stress fibers and microtubules), DNA and amyloid protofilaments. During my PhD, I built and optimized a dSTORM microscope with polarized detection. This is where my love for image processing and photonics began to drive my career.</p>

<p align="justify">In 2016, I joined Ludger Johannes as postdoc and imaging specialist in Lattice Light-Sheet microscopy (LLSM) at Curie Institute. My project was to study different modes of endocytosis, using LLSM and single particle tracking. In 2019, I joined Charles Kervrann and Jean Salamero joint team, Serpico/STED. I work in different projects including data management (BioImageIT), machine learning, image processing and big data. Also, I am responsible of LLSM projects at Curie Institute with Ludovic Leconte. </p>

<p align="justify">In addition, I work in close collaboration with private companies including: Myriade (Biotech startup) and Gataca Systems.</p>

<p align="justify">Finally, I am a founder member of the LightSheet Community "Wildsheet", aiming to bring together users of light sheet instruments to share knowledge and best practices.

# Research experience #

### <u> Postdoctoral Researcher:</u>  Serpico/STED Team 
<b>01/2022 - Current</b> *Project: Polarization Microscopy for Imaging of Membrane Organization (PoMIMO).*

<p align="justify">LabEx Cell(n)Scale collaborative project between Inria and Curie Institute. Implementation of polarization module in a STORM-TIRFM (PolarSTORM) system at Curie Institute. Developing of image analysis workflow of biomolecules tracking and estimating spatial high-resolution maps of molecular mobility.</p>


### <u> Research engineer:</u> Inria-Myriade Biotech 
<b>01/2021 - 12/2021</b> *Project: Improvement of tracking and size estimation of virus and extracellular vesicles.*

<p align="justify">Collaboration between SERPICO Team and the Biotech startup Myriade. I develop mathematical models and image processing tools to improve the tracking and size estimation of virus and extracellular vesicles in their system VideoDrop.</p>

### <u> Inria Starting Research Position:</u> Serpico/STED Team
<b>04/2019 - 12/2020</b> *Project:Acquisition, analysis, and visualization of 3D Dynamic cellular imaging of endocytosis/recycling mechanisms in the membrane during cell migration using machine learning.*

<p align="justify">I work in novel machine learning methods of image processing able to detect the main regions of interest, and automatic quantification of molecular interactions and cell processes. In addition, I collaborate in the development of machine learning-driven navigation and interaction techniques for 3D+Time data enabling the analysis of localized intra-cellular events (endocytosis and exocytosis) and cell processes (migration, division, etc.). </p>

### <u> Postdoctoral:</u> Ludger Johannes Team 
<b>01/2016 - 03/2019</b> *Project:Advanced cellular imaging of endocytosis.*

<p align="justify">Development of 3D image processing and quantification methods to study different modes of endocytosis, using advanced high spatio-temporal resolution imaging and single particle tracking. In addition, I was also responsible of setting up a Lattice Light Sheet Microscope on the PICT-IBiSA imaging facility at Curie Institute, which is part of the France BioImaging National Infrastructure.</p>
