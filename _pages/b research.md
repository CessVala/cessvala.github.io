<strong>Biological</strong> imaging has seen significant advancements in new microscopy techniques, allowing for the visualization of sub-cellular components with <strong>improved spatial and temporal resolution</strong>. Nevertheless, the interaction between <strong>biology</strong>, <strong>fluorescence microscopy</strong> and <strong>informatics</strong> brings new challenges, including big data analysis and 4D visualization. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
<strong>My current research focuses</strong> on studying the cell division mechanism of cyanobacteria. This involves developing automatic tracking methods for single cells, single filaments, or cell populations, as well as multidimensional image analysis techniques using <strong>deep learning</strong>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
To achieve this, I work on image processing and data analysis across various multidisciplinary problems, including <strong>quantitative nanoscale imaging of orientational order</strong> and <strong>3D intracellular process tracking and visualization</strong>. Additionally, I am involved in data pre-processing and data management.
