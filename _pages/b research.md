<p align="justify">Biological imaging has experienced a big development of new microscopy techniques that allows visualization of sub-cellular components and organelles, with better spatial and temporal resolution. Nevertheless, the interaction between cell biology, fluorescence microscopy and informatics brings new challenges, including big data analysis and 4D visualization. During my research career, I have focused mainly on image processing and data analysis of two different multi-disciplinary problems: Quantitative nanoscale imaging of orientational order and 3D Intracellular process tracking and visualization. In addition, I work in Data pre-processing and Data management.</p>
