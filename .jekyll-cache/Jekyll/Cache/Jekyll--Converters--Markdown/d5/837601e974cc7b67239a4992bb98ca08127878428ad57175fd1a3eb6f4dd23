I"@<p align="justify">Hi, my name is Cesar Augusto Valades-Cruz. I am a Postdoctoral researcher of Serpico/STED joint team at Curie Institute and Inria Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique. My project is focused on microscope development and image analysis.</p>

<p align="justify">My background is quite broad as I studied Mechatronics Engineering. Then, I got a MSc in Nanophotonics. Later, I completed a PhD in Biophotonics from Fresnel Institute and ICFO. My master and PhD were founded by Erasmus Mundus. My PhD was centered on quantitative nanoscale imaging of orientational order in biological filaments (actin stress fibers and microtubules), DNA and amyloid protofilaments. During my PhD, I built and optimized a dSTORM microscope with polarized detection. This is where my love for image processing and photonics began to drive my career.</p>

<p align="justify">In 2016, I joined Ludger Johannes as postdoc and imaging specialist in Lattice Light-Sheet microscopy (LLSM) at Curie Institute. My project was to study different modes of endocytosis, using LLSM and single particle tracking. In 2019, I joined Charles Kervrann and Jean Salamero joint team, Serpico/STED. I work in different projects including data management (BioImageIT), machine learning, image processing and big data. Also, I am responsible of LLSM projects at Curie Institute with Ludovic Leconte. </p>

<p align="justify">In addition, I work in close collaboration with private companies including: Myriade (Biotech startup) and Gataca Systems.</p>

<p align="justify">Finally, I am a founder member of the LightSheet Community "Wildsheet", aiming to bring together users of light sheet instruments to share knowledge and best practices.
